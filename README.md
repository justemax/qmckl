![Build Status](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/workflows/test-build/badge.svg?branch=master)

The domain of quantum chemistry needs a library in which the main
kernels of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are implemented. In the
library proposed in this project, we expose the main algorithms in a
simple language and provide a standard API and tests to enable the
development of high-performance QMCkl implementations taking
advantage of modern hardware.

See the [source code](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/org/qmckl.org)
to read the documentation.


To clone the repository, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl.git
```

# Installation

The simplest way to obtain the source files of QMCkl is to download a source
distribution. This particular repository is for maintainers, who write the kernels
in org-mode files and produce the source code and the documentation from these files.

## For maintainers

```
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$PWD/_install

make
make check
```

## For users

Obtain a source distribution.

To build the documentation version:

```
./configure
```

To build an optimized version with Intel compilers:
```
./configure \
   --with-icc \
   --with-ifort \
   --enable-hpc \
   --with-openmp
```

To build an optimized version with GCC:
```
./configure \
  CC=gcc \
  CFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=native  -flto -fno-trapping-math -fno-math-errno -ftree-vectorize" \
  FC=gfortran \
  FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=native  -flto -ftree-vectorize" \
  --enable-hpc \
  --with-openmp
```


Then, compile with:
```
make -j
make -j check
sudo make install
sudo make installcheck
```


## Installation procedure for Guix users

QMCkl can be installed with the [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) functional package manager.
The [qmckl.scm](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/tools/qmckl.scm)
Schema file contains the manifest specification for the `qmckl` installations.
It can be installed within the selected `$GUIX_PROFILE` as follows:

```
guix package \
	--profile=$GUIX_PROFILE 		\
	--load-path=<path_to_trexio_scm> 	\
	--cores=<n_cores>			\
	--install-from-file=qmckl.scm
```

where `<path_to_trexio_scm>` should point to a folder, which contains the TREXIO manifest file
[trexio.scm](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/blob/master/tools/trexio.scm)
(e.g. `~/trexio/tools/` if TREXIO repository was cloned under $HOME).

Installation procedures for both development version (`qmckl-dev`) 
and stable releases (`qmckl-hpc`) are provided.
One can switch between them using the return value (last line) 
in the `qmckl.scm` file.


## Linking to your program

The `make install` command takes care of installing the QMCkl shared library on the user machine.
Once installed, add `-lqmckl` to the list of compiler options.

In some cases (e.g. when using custom `prefix` during configuration), the QMCkl library might end up installed in a directory, which is absent in the default `$LIBRARY_PATH`.
In order to link the program against QMCkl, the search paths can be modified as follows:

`export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_qmckl>/lib`

(same holds for `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). The `<path_to_qmckl>` has to be replaced with the prefix used during the installation.

If your project relies on the CMake build system, feel free to use the
[FindQMCKL.cmake](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/cmake/FindQMCKL.cmake)
module to find and link the QMCkl library automatically.


## Verificarlo CI

Since Verificarlo should not be a dependency of QMCkl, all Verificarlo
functions are called only when the support is explicitely enabled (and ignored
by the preprocessor otherwise). To enable vfc_ci support, the library should be
configured with the following command :

```
./configure \
  CC="verificarlo-f" \
  FC="verificarlo-f" \
  --prefix=$PWD/_install \
  --enable-vfc_ci \
  --host=x86_64 \
```

where CC and FC are set to verificarlo-f, and support is explicitely enabled
with the --enable-vfc_ci flag. Configuring the library with the "standard"
command will cause all calls to Verificarlo related functions to be ignored,
and the library will be built as usual.
